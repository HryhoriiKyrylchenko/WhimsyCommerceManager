# Whimsy Architecture

## Overview

Whimsy is a marketplace platform that allows:
- The owner to list their products.
- Sellers to create accounts and list their products.
- Inventory and logistics management functionalities, where the platform can handle both the owner's and sellers' product shipping.

The architecture is designed for scalability, flexibility, and security, ensuring that the platform can accommodate future growth and complex features.

## Architectural Style

The architecture follows a **Microservices**-like structure, even though the system is monolithic at its core. This means each part of the application (e.g., product management, user authentication, orders, logistics) is loosely coupled and follows a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** approach. This modular approach allows easier future scaling, maintenance, and potential future splitting into microservices.

## Core Components

### 1. **Frontend**
The frontend will be built using **Blazor** (or an alternative like **React** or **Angular**) to provide a rich user experience for both customers and sellers.

- **Features**:
  - User authentication (login, registration, role-based access).
  - Product browsing, search, and filtering.
  - Cart and checkout process.
  - Order management interface for customers and sellers.
  - Admin dashboard for managing users, products, and orders.
  - Seller dashboard for inventory management, order processing, and analytics.

### 2. **Backend**
The backend is developed in **.NET Core** and will follow the principles of **Clean Architecture** with distinct layers: Presentation, Application, Domain, and Infrastructure.

- **Layers**:
  - **Presentation Layer (API)**: Exposes the public API for communication with the frontend. This layer includes controllers, request models, and HTTP responses.
  - **Application Layer**: Contains use cases, services, and logic for executing operations (e.g., creating an order, processing payments). 
  - **Domain Layer**: Represents the core of the business logic, including entities (e.g., Product, Order, User), value objects, and domain services.
  - **Infrastructure Layer**: Deals with external concerns like databases (SQL Server), third-party services (payment gateways, shipping providers), and communication mechanisms (email, messaging).

### 3. **Database Layer**
The database will use **SQL Server** (or a similar RDBMS) with **Entity Framework Core** as the ORM to map objects to database tables.

- **Entities**:
  - **User**: Represents both customers and sellers. Includes roles (admin, seller, customer).
  - **Product**: Represents a product listed by a seller, with fields for price, description, stock levels, and images.
  - **Order**: Stores order details, statuses, and customer information.
  - **Payment**: Stores payment information for completed orders.
  - **Inventory**: Tracks product stock levels.
  - **Shipment**: Stores shipping and delivery details for each order.

### 4. **Authentication and Authorization**
- **Identity** is handled via **ASP.NET Core Identity**, managing user accounts, roles (admin, seller, customer), and authentication (via JWT tokens or cookies).
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** ensures that users can only access appropriate parts of the system. For example, sellers can manage their own products, but only admins can manage users and products across all sellers.

### 5. **API Layer**
The **API Layer** will expose endpoints for various functionalities, such as product management, order processing, and payments.

- **Core API Endpoints**:
  - **Products**: `GET /api/products`, `POST /api/products`, `PUT /api/products/{id}`, `DELETE /api/products/{id}`
  - **Orders**: `GET /api/orders`, `POST /api/orders`, `PUT /api/orders/{id}`
  - **Payments**: `POST /api/payments`
  - **Users**: `GET /api/users`, `POST /api/users`, `PUT /api/users/{id}`

Each endpoint will have proper validation, error handling, and authentication checks.

### 6. **Inventory Management**
Inventory management is integrated into the system to handle:
- Stock levels.
- Replenishment alerts.
- Real-time inventory tracking during order fulfillment.

### 7. **Order and Shipping Management**
- **Order Workflow**:
  - Customers place orders through the storefront.
  - Sellers confirm and ship the orders, or the platform handles shipping for seller products.
  - Order statuses are updated in real-time (e.g., "pending", "shipped", "delivered").
  
- **Shipping Integration**:
  - The platform integrates with third-party logistics providers for live shipping rates and real-time tracking.
  - The system generates shipping labels and tracking information.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - Blazor, React, or Angular for building dynamic, single-page applications.
- **Backend**:
  - .NET Core (C#) for RESTful API development.
  - ASP.NET Core Identity for user authentication.
  - Entity Framework Core for database interaction.
- **Database**:
  - SQL Server for relational data storage.
  - Redis for caching frequently accessed data.
- **Payment Integration**:
  - Stripe or PayPal for handling payments.
- **Messaging Queue**:
  - RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus for asynchronous operations (e.g., order processing, notifications).
- **Shipping Integration**:
  - APIs of third-party logistics providers (e.g., UPS, FedEx) for real-time rates and tracking.

---

## Communication and Data Flow

1. **Frontend** sends API requests to the **Backend API** for data retrieval and updates.
2. **Backend API** interacts with the **Database Layer** to fetch/store data.
3. **Order Services** send email/SMS notifications to users about order status changes (e.g., order confirmation, shipment).
4. **Inventory Management** keeps track of stock levels in real-time, updating automatically when an order is placed or shipped.
5. **Shipping** integrates with external logistics providers for real-time quotes and tracking information.

## Scalability and Future Enhancements

- **Microservices Transition**: While the system starts as a monolithic application, future expansion can transition to microservices, especially in areas like order processing, payments, and inventory management.
- **Load Balancing**: To handle high traffic, the system will be designed to work with load balancers, possibly with containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes).
- **Mobile App Development**: Future versions of the platform may include mobile applications (iOS/Android).
- **AI and Machine Learning**: Integration of recommendation engines and predictive analytics for personalized shopping experiences.

---

## Security Considerations

- **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for secure, stateless authentication.
- **HTTPS** for secure communication between frontend, backend, and third-party services.
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** to limit access to sensitive data.
- **Data Encryption** for sensitive customer information, including payments.
- **Regular security audits** and updates to protect from vulnerabilities.

---

This architecture ensures that **Whimsy** will be a flexible, scalable, and secure platform capable of supporting complex marketplace features with ease.
